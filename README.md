This is a simple project to use the giphy API to be able to find trending gifs
and search for gifs.  Built on top of an ejected create-react-app with Redux ontop, with
support for Redux devtools.

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

- included in the images folder is a corrupted gif (for the upload to fail) and a good_cat gif which you can upload to giphy.
